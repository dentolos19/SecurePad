# SecurePad [![Code Quality](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/7fdc853e58a5469db1a6a5b8e914faf4)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/dentolos19/SecurePad?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=dentolos19/SecurePad&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

A simple text editor with high-level encryption, but don't guarantee that this will fully-protect your files! I made this project because of my personal hobby of creating replica of other programs and improving them from scratch! I won't be maintaining this project unless I need to fix something, but any contributions to this project will be helpful thanks!
